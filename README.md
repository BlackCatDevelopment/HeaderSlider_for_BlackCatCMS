catGallery for Black Cat CMS
===============================

This is a module for Black Cat CMS. It was originally published as "HeaderSlider", but as there are many new functions added by now it was renamed to "catGallery".
With this module you can easily add and manage an image slider or even simple galleries.

The module uses Skitter in the default setting: https://github.com/thiagosf/SkitterSlideshow

Please note that this is work in progress!
